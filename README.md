# Macy's Web Scraper

This repository contains a set of Python scripts and files to scrape product information from Macy's website.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files as a ZIP archive.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the required Python packages by running the following command:
`ip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Open the `categories_exec.py` file and provide the necessary inputs when prompted:
- Enter the gender (mens/womens)
- Enter the category (e.g., dresses, mens-activewear)
- Enter the comma-separated list of brands
- Enter the ID

Example:
Enter gender (mens/womens): womens
Enter category (e.g., dresses, mens-activewear): dresses
Enter brands (comma-separated): Calvin Klein, DKNY, Tommy Hilfiger
Enter ID: 5449

This will generate a `categories.txt` file containing the category URLs based on the provided inputs.

2. Open the `scraper_macy.py` file and modify the following variables if needed:
- `api_key`: Replace with your Scraper API key.
- `input_file`: Specify the path to the input CSV file containing the product information to be updated.
- `output_file`: Specify the path where the updated CSV file will be saved.
- `categories_file`: Specify the path to the `categories.txt` file generated in step 1.

3. Run the `scraper_macy.py` script using the following command:
    `python scraper_macy.py`

The script will start scraping the product information from Macy's website based on the provided category URLs and update the specified CSV file.

4. Once the script finishes executing, the updated CSV file will be saved at the specified `output_file` path.

## File Descriptions

- `categories_exec.py`: A Python script that generates the `categories.txt` file based on user inputs for gender, category, brands, and ID.
- `scraper_macy.py`: The main Python script that scrapes product information from Macy's website and updates the specified CSV file.
- `requirements.txt`: A text file containing the required Python packages and their versions.
- `categories.txt`: A text file that stores the category URLs generated by `categories_exec.py`. This file is used by `scraper_macy.py` to scrape the product information.

## Notes

- Make sure you have a valid Scraper API key to access Macy's website.
- The script assumes a maximum of 23 pages for each category. If there are more pages, you may need to modify the `generate_categories` function in `categories_exec.py` accordingly.
- The script updates the product information in the specified CSV file based on the "Shipping Returns Info" column. Rows with blank or empty values in this column will be updated with the scraped information.
